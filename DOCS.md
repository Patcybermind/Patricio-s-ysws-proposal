## how to replicate:
Copy the arduino sketch from the arduino folder then upload it to an arduino. wire according to the naming of the variables and their defined pins A and B can be interchanged that doesnt matter unless you start doing subtraction and other operations.
Once that's done download the [5v 1-bit full adder](https://github.com/Patcybermind/Patricio-s-ysws-proposal/blob/main/paul%20falstad%20circuit%20sim%20circuits/1bitrcadone5v.txt) and solder all the components to some protoboard or wire them up on a breadboard accordingly.
Run and that should be it
